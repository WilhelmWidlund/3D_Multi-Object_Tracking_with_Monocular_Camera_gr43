GuillaumeMOT
================
This is an extension of the EagerMOT multi-object tracker, which can be seen at the repository https://github.com/aleksandrkim61/EagerMOT
The idea of this extension is to allow for using scores from several methods of re-identification, by allowing for the creation of a new affinity matrix. 
This matrix is concatenated with the original EagerMOT affinity matrix, resulting in a new one which is influenced by both.
